# Places App

Places is toolkit for builders to manage and sell their pre-construction inventory. It provides an easy and efficient way to help builders create pages for their new properties, mark properties as available for sale, and update these as needed. This will also help with communication between builders and buyers, and manage the increasing demand for pre-construction properties.

Features to be added to the app include a contact form for buyers to message builders or sales agents directly. An additional feature could be user authentication, for users to login and save properties of interest in a 'favourites' section.
